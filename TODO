Lots to do...

* use Tika (or similiar) to extract text from _attachments
* Dublin Core?
* use javascript to let couchdb user to program output transformation rather than current blanket strategy
* better lifecycle management (couchdb keeps killing our java process when it thinks a query is too slow, this prevents ever building a decent FieldCache for sorting, etc).
