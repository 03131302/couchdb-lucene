Lots to do...

* remember where we left off and avoid redoing those things.
* delete documents when deleted
* delete databases that no longer exist (use TermEnum or TermDocs to find all databases in Lucene, use .deleteDocuments() to zap them)
* delete old version of document when updated
* store _id and _rev
* refresh reader after successful commit
