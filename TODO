Search Performance

* add an _optimize option.
* add Cache-Control: max-age=(minimum number of seconds before we commit)

Index Performance

* handle "create" and "delete" notifications explicitly.
* reindex when transform function changes.
* hit highlighting (lucene contrib).
* clustering (carrot2).
* distributed search.
* JSONQuery? (http://docs.persvr.org/documentation/jsonquery)
