Search Performance

* sort cache can take too long to build, respond with keep-alive messages.
* add an _optimize option.
* distributed scoring.

Index Performance

* batch updates (no hair trigger).

Misc

* hit highlighting (lucene contrib).
* clustering (carrot2).
* distributed search.
* JSONQuery? (http://docs.persvr.org/documentation/jsonquery)
* geospatial (need TrieRangeQuery from 2.9)
* use Nutch's ngram LanguageIdentifier and override Tika's guess.
