Search Performance

* sort cache can take too long to build, respond with keep-alive messages.
* add an _optimize option.
* add Cache-Control: max-age=(minimum number of seconds before we commit)
* retrieve a page in one request not N requests.

Index Performance

* batch updates (no hair trigger).

Misc

* add a _status uri that lets you see index state/progress.
* handle "create" and "delete" notifications explicitly.
* reindex when transform function changes.
* hit highlighting (lucene contrib).
* clustering (carrot2).
* distributed search.
* JSONQuery? (http://docs.persvr.org/documentation/jsonquery)
