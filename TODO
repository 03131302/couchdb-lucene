Lots to do...

* use Tika (or similiar) to extract text from _attachments
* Dublin Core?
* use javascript to let couchdb user to program output transformation rather than current blanket strategy
* retrieve all X hits for include_docs in one call using multi fetch.
* translate range queries to use FieldCache for correct int/float handling.
